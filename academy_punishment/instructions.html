            This is a public goods game with
            {{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }} players per group,
            an endowment of {{ C.ENDOWMENT }},
            and an efficiency factor of {{ C.MULTIPLIER }}.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can punish each player up to {{ C.MAX_PUNISHMENT }} points.
            Each punishment point will reduce the player's payoff by {{ C.PERCENT_PER_PUNISHMENT }}%,
            but will incur a cost to you, in accordance with the following table.
        </p>

        <table class="table table-sm table-borderd bg-body caption-top">
            <caption>The Effect and Cost of Punishment</caption>
            <tr>
                <th>Punishment</th>
                {{ for points in C.COST_TABLE.points }}
                    <td>{{ points }}</td>
                {{ endfor }}
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Reduction</th>
                {{ for percentage in C.COST_TABLE.percentage }}
                    <td>{{ percentage }}</td>
                {{ endfor }}
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Cost ({{ C.CURRENCY_SYMBOL }})</th>
                {{ for cost in C.COST_TABLE.cost }}
                    <td>{{ cost }}</td>
                {{ endfor }}
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Even though the punishment a player receives from their peers is summed together, the overall reduction is capped at {{ C.MAX_PUNISHMENT}} points.</p>

        <p>This game will be played for <strong>{{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds</strong>.</p>
