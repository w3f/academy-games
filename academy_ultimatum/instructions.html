            First, every player will be randomly paired with another player. In
            other words, you will have a counterpart, but you will not be told
            who it is.
            Your identity will also remain hidden from your counterpart.
        </p>

        <p>
            The two participants in a pair will have two different roles: the
            <strong>proposer</strong> and the <strong>responder</strong>.
            You will be assigned randomly to a role, and it will be displayed
            on the next page.
        </p>

        <p>
            The two of you will together receive {{ Constants.endowment }}. The
            experiment is about how to divide this amount.
            The proposer will make the responder a take-it-or-leave-it offer,
            which the responder can accept or reject.
            If the offer is rejected, both will
            receive {{ Constants.payoff_if_rejected }}.

        </p>


        <h4>
            Proposer's role
        </h4>

        <p>
            The proposer has the following {{ Constants.num_offers }}
            options on how to divide the {{ Constants.endowment }} between the
            two players.
        </p>

        <table class="table table-sm table-borderd bg-body caption-top">
            <caption>Options for Proposer</caption>
            <tr>
                <th>Reward Responder</th>
                {{ for o in offers }}
                <td>{{ o }}</td>
                {{ endfor }}
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Reward Proposer</th>
                {{ for r in reward }}
                <td>{{ r }}</td>
                {{ endfor }}
            </tr>

        <h4>
            Responder's role
        </h4>

        <p>
                The responder can either accept or reject the offer.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Results
        </h4>

        <p>
                In the end, when both players have made their decision, a
                results page will be displayed.
                Here the offer will be displayed once more, and whether it was
                accepted or rejected.
        </p>

        Furthermore, one of the following two payoffs will be displayed:
        <ul>
            <li>If the offer is accepted, the players will receive a payoff
                accordingly
            </li>
            <li>If the offer is rejected, both players will
                receive {{ Constants.payoff_if_rejected }}</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
