            This is a public goods game with <strong>{{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }} players</strong>
            per group, an efficiency factor of <strong>{{ C.MULTIPLIER }}</strong>
            and an endowment of <strong>{{ C.ENDOWMENT_ROUND }}</strong> per round.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, an initial endowment of <strong>{{ C.ENDOWMENT_INITIAL }}</strong> is provided at the start of the game.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the first phase, each player chooses how much of their round's endowment they would like to contribute
            to the shared pot of public good. The value of this good is the multiplied by the efficiency factor. The resulting
            points are divided equally among all players.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the second phase, each player can decide to destroy up to <strong>{{ C.PUNISHMENT_MAX }}%</strong> of the other players payoff
            from the previous phase at a cost to the player itself, in accordance with the following table:
        </p>

        <table class="table table-sm table-borderd bg-body caption-top">
            <caption>The Effect and Cost of Punishment</caption>
           <tr>
                <th>Reduction</th>
                {{ for percentage in C.COST_TABLE.percentage }}
                    <td>{{ percentage }}</td>
                {{ endfor }}
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Cost ({{ C.CURRENCY_SYMBOL }})</th>
                {{ for cost in C.COST_TABLE.cost }}
                    <td>{{ cost }}</td>
                {{ endfor }}
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Even though the punishment a player receives from their peers is summed together, the overall reduction is capped to <strong>{{ C.PUNISHMENT_MAX }}%</strong>.</p>

        <p>This game will be played for <strong>{{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds</strong>.</p>
